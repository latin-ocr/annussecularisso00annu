iMPORTANT ΝΟΤΕ - ειη 8”><ΙΟ” gray card underfills the 5[) camera's
7.3”ΧΙΟ.9” field of view (FOV) at 400 ΡΡΙ, so be sure to reset the camera's
rnetering mode as described below to only sample the center of the FOV.
The normal evaluative metering mode samples nearly the entire FOV, and
the outer portion could improperly alter the exposure determination.
Setting the optirnal exposure at 400 ΡΡΙ, rather than 500 ΡΡΙ, is
advantageous for two reasons. First, the effective aperture changes with
focal length. lmages taken with the same exposure settings at 300 ΡΡΙ will
be about ll6 stop brighter than at 400 ΡΡΙ, while images tal<en at 500 ΡΡΙ
will be about ll6 stop fainter. By setting the exposure for 400 ΡΡΙ, the
differences will be only ἑ lle> stop from the optimal exposure, rather than
as much as ψ ll3 stop, if the optimum exposure were set at 500 ΡΡΙ.
Second, a modest fraction of lenses have been observed to overexpose by
about ll6 stop at 500 ΡΡΙ, while no lens has ever shown any anomalies at
400 ΡΡΙ, making that ΡΡΙ setting more reliable for exposure determinations.
